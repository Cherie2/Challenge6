# Weather-Forecast

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is to create a website that allows users to search for a specific city's weather conditions. The temperature, wind speed and humidity of the city will be available for reference in a 5 day forecast. When the user searches for a specified city, the city will be saved in the history and made available to the user as a button for future ease of selection. The simple yet responsive design of the website is stream-lined for use on various screen sizes.

In completing this project I have learned the process of utilizing data from third-party APIs in my web application.I have been able to exercise knowledge in the use of variables, functions, for loops, event listeners, local storage, data attributes, time structure, and creating/appending elements in HTML.
